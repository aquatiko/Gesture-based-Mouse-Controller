# Gesture-based-Mouse-Controller

## How to use?
1. Run the ipynb and keep a static background in the blue rectangele for some time. It is used for calibrating background, so that we can later detect objects in that frame.
2. Use fingers to control mouse movement i.e 1-Left    2-Right   3-Up  4-Down
3. When the cursor is at desired position, blink both your eyes for 1-2 sec for a left click at the position.
4. Press 'q' to exit and 'r' to reset background (remember the white parts in threshold window is what the feed is detecting, so make sure it's only your hand)
